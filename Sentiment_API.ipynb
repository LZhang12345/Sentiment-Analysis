      "['All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This was a good quarter for our community and our business and a strong end to the year. There are now around 2.9 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month and around 2.3 billion people using at least one of our services daily. There are now more than 140 million small businesses that use our services to grow, and the vast majority of which use our services for free.\\n', \"Last year, I shared our four company priorities, and they're still our priorities in 2020: making progress on the major social issues, building qualitatively new product experiences, continuing to grow our business, and getting out there and communicating more transparently. Today, I'm going to focus mostly on the new product experiences we're building, but before I get to that, this is going to be another critical year for making progress on social issues.\\n\", \"We're very focused on election integrity, and this is an area where I'm proud of the progress we have made preventing foreign interference. We were behind in 2016, but after working to protect elections and countries across the world from the EU -- in the EU to India to Mexico to the US midterms for the past few years, we think our systems are now more advanced than any other company's. And we're often alerting law enforcement and intelligence about threats that we identify. There's still going to be debates about what kinds of political speech should be allowed, especially as the 2020 elections heat up, but by any objective measures, our efforts in election integrity have made a lot of progress.\\n\", \"This is also going to be a big year for our greater focus on privacy as well. As part of our FTC settlement, we committed to building privacy controls and auditing that will set a new standard for our industry going beyond anything that's required by law today. We currently have more than 1,000 engineers working on privacy-related projects and helping to build out this program.\\n\", \"Related to this, just yesterday we announced that we're rolling out a privacy checkup tool to nearly 2 billion people, reminding them of the control they have in making sure that they're set the way that they want them. We also introduced a new tool that notifies you any time your account signs into a new service. So it's going to take time, but over the next decade I want us to build a reputation on privacy that's as strong as our reputation already building good, stable services.\\n\", \"When it comes to these important social issues, I don't think the private companies should be making so many important decisions by themselves. I don't think that each service should have to individually decide what content or advertising is allowed during elections or what content is harmful overall. There should be a more democratic process for determining these rules and regulations. For these issues, it's not enough for us to just make principle decisions. The decisions also need to be seen as legitimate and reflecting what the community wants. And that's why I've called for clearer regulation for our industry. And until we get clearer rules or establish other mechanisms of governance, I expect that we and our whole industry will continue to face a very high level of scrutiny.\\n\", \"So during this, our job is to keep doing what we think is right on the social issues and to stay focused on continuing to deliver product improvements and better experiences for our community. The product areas that I'm most focused on for the next chapter of our company are building out the private social platform and more intimate communities, enabling more commerce and payments, and delivering the next computing platform.\\n\", \"When I look at the Internet today, we all have this ability to connect with people and content and opportunities coming from all around the world in ways that were unimaginable just a generation ago. Now, I grew up in a town of 10,000 people, and making long distance calls anywhere outside the area was very expensive. Today we all have access to billions of people, and that's made it easier to find people who are into the same things that you are. But as our networks and communities have gotten so large, we increasingly crave a sense of intimacy and privacy. So delivering this experience is our focus.\\n\", \"And across our services, the greatest growth in how people are communicating continues to come from private messaging, small groups, and disappearing stories where your data doesn't stick around forever. There's a lot more to do here. While the Facebook and Instagram apps have developed with lots of different ways to interact with the people you care about, our private communication apps are still pretty much just about texting. So we spent the last year building infrastructure to turn our private messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger into richer private social platforms where you can hang out and be present with friends, find groups with your interest, and engage with businesses more naturally.\\n\", \"So, some of these are bigger projects like full end-to-end encryption, interoperability across the apps, or rewriting our apps for performance, and they're going to take a long time to see through. But we should start seeing more new experiences later this year, and this will all be built on a very strong privacy foundation.\\n\", \"Commerce and payments is another area that will be important for the private social platform, but also across all of our apps, including Facebook and Instagram. Our goal here is to make sure that every individual, small business entrepreneur out there has the same opportunity and access to the same type of sophisticated tools that historically only the big companies have had access to. That's what we stand for: putting power in individuals' hands.\\n\", \"One example that we have been working on is WhatsApp Payments. You're going to be able to send money as quickly and easily as sending a photo. We got approval to test this with a million people in India back in 2018. And when so many of the people kept using it week after week, we knew it was going to be big when we get to launch. I'm really excited about this, and I expect this to start rolling out in a number of countries and for us to make a lot of progress here in the next six months.\\n\", \"Beyond WhatsApp Payments, we're working on several other efforts to help facilitate more commerce from Facebook Marketplace to Instagram Shopping to our work on Facebook Pay or our work on Libra. This is such a big space, and it's important for empowering people. So we're taking a number of different approaches here, ranging from people buying and selling to each other directly, to businesses setting up storefronts, to people engaging with businesses directly through messaging, and a number of things on payments ranging from existing -- using existing national systems like India's UPI to creating new global systems.\\n\", \"Having small businesses succeed is not only key to creating broad economic growth where everyone can support themselves. It's also important to maintain healthy communities. So small businesses are often where people come together. We see on our services all the time how small businesses that use our tools are often at the heart of their local communities. So this is a top priority for us on both fronts, for the social mission and the business.\\n\", \"We've also been focusing on delivering the next computing platform with augmented and virtual reality. The defining characteristic of AR and VR is that they deliver the sense of presence, like you're right there with another person or in another place, and this is the holy grail of social experiences. And it's going to let us build things that we've only dreamed of for the last 15 years, like letting people interact as if they're in person together no matter where they are, or letting people live wherever they want and hologram into work so they can access opportunities anywhere and don't have to move to a city or another country to find a job.\\n\", \"So while full augmented reality is still a number of years away, we hit a real milestone for virtual reality with Quest. Sales are stronger than we expected, and people are buying and engaging with more content than we expected to. On Christmas Day, people bought almost $5 million worth of content in the Oculus Store. And that's an outlier day, but still this is real volume by any measure. And it shows the progress that this ecosystem is making.\\n\", \"The experience also just keeps on getting better. Last quarter, we shipped hand tracking, which no one thought was going to be possible with Quest hardware. And we shipped Oculus Link, so now you can run all of your RIFT content from your PC on Quest. On the AR side, while we're working on the long term hardware and operating system, it's worth noting that our Spark AR platform is the most widely used AR platform in the world with hundreds of millions of people interacting every month. Artists are using this to create new face filters and other tools that are going viral across Instagram and Facebook. We're well positioned here overall, and we're going to keep developing this platform.\\n\", \"So those are some of the bigger product initiatives that I'm excited about, and aside from these, we're also focused on communicating more clearly what we stand for. One critique of our approach for much of the last decade was that because we wanted to be liked, we didn't always communicate our views as clearly because we were worried about offending people. So this led to some positive but shallow sentiment toward us and toward the company. And my goal for this next decade isn't to be liked but to be understood, because in order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for.\\n\", \"So we're going to focus more on communicating our principles, whether that's standing up for giving people a voice against those who would censor people who don't agree with them, standing up for letting people build their own communities against those who say that new types of communities forming on social media are dividing us, standing up for encryption against those who say that privacy mostly helps bad people, standing up for giving small businesses more important and sophisticated tools against those who say that targeted advertising is a problem, or standing up for serving every person in the world against those who say that you have to pay a premium in order to really be served.\\n\", \"These positions aren't always going to be popular, but I think it's important for us to take these debates head on. I know that there are a lot of people who agree with these principles, and there are a whole lot more who are open to them and want to see these arguments get made. So expect more of that this year.\\n\", \"This is going to be another important year. It's going to be an intense year with the elections. Some of our long-term technology bets are going to start coming to fruition. We have strong business momentum, and we have to get out there and show what we stand for. As always, I am grateful to all of you for your support and for being on this journey with us.\\n\", \"And now, I'm going to hand it over to Sheryl to talk about our business.\\n\", '\\n']\n",
